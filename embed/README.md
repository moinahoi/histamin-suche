# Embed Histamin-Suche

![Histamin-Suche embedded](../marketing/store/embed.png "Histamin-Suche embedded")

This site is to demonstrate how to embed the Histamin-Suche website in your site. It shows how it performs in a small iframe and which settings you can use to optimize the user experience. This site uses the hosted Histamin-Suche site at [histamin-suche.web.app](https://histamin-suche.web.app) as this is how it would look like in other site integrations.

You can embed Histamin-Suche without any parameters. This would end in an app-like appearance for device-widths up to 800px. Any devices wider than that are displayed in desktop-mode.

However, Histamin-Suche is best experienced using the `embed` parameter.

# Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| embed | The parameter `?embed=1` switches from an app-like appearance to fullscreen overlays. This makes it less app-in-an-app like and more integrated in your site. |

# Font

The font used for the wireframe texts is called BLOKK ([GitHub](https://github.com/los-gordos/BLOKK)).
