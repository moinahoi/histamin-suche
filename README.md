# Histamin-Suche

# Pre-Requisites

Nothing. No seriously: No build tool needed. It's just vanilla javascript and basic HTML plus CSS - all in one file (except for the manifest and service worker file).

# Features

- Easy & fast search
- Offline available
- PWA: Install as app
- Dark mode
- Embed mode: Embed histamine search in your website and enable with `?embed=1`. This works best for sizes up to 800px and uses fullscreen instead of app-like overlays. See [embed readme](/embed/README.md) for more information.

# Commands

- `:la`: list all. Lists all data in the database
